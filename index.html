<h2>Origins of House</h2>

<article>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>In order to understand house culture today, we must look back at its roots. House dance is undoubtedly tied to house music, but their developments were not parallel. A clear distinction can be seen between the two, beginning with their geographic origins. While house music is rooted in Chicago, house dance began to flourish and evolve on the east coast, in New York City. House culture, built with emphasis on community and collaboration, was the perfect setting for a style that relies heavily on connection and individuality to blossom .</p>
	
	<p>During the early 1980s, a new genre of music was emerging. Inspired by disco of the years prior and European electropop, House music born.<br>Following the growing popularity of house music and recreational spaces created for it, house dance began gaining traction as well.</p>

	<h4>Chicago and New York</h4>
	
	<p>One of the earliest pioneers of house was Frankie Knuckles, who is also known as the <q>Grandfather of House Music.</q> Frankie Knuckles had a large part in popularizing the genre, which in turn resulted in House reaching much further than Illinois. Knuckles would often play music at a club called The Warehouse, where the genre gets its name. Located on the Near West Side, The Warehouse owed much of its popularity to its culture of disregarding the social restrictions of gender and sexuality. After the virtual disappearance of established gay recreational spaces during the 50s, 60s, and 70s, for the black, gay community in Chicago, the Warehouse provided an outlet for them to be themselves which they had not had in three decades. The house clubs in Chicago became an integral part of multiple communities.</P>
	
	<p>A similar environment cropped up in New York, becoming popular for similar reasons. One particular club, New York City's <q>Paradise Garage</q> is noteworthy in familiarizing many with house music. At the core of both of these clubs is a theme of liberation, which is reflected directly in the physicality of house dance.</p>

	<p>In the early years of house dance, the clubs were instrumental in passing on new moves and styles. This was just a short intro to the genre for myself and whoever may view.</p>
